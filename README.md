## Overview
Before we get into this guide, I would like to acknowlegde that I was inspired by [Leo's EveryDay Tech's Awesome Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kCzdO9x5lM) on hiding his ssd on the back of his storage locked computer, we are taking this to the extreme, and implementing it OS level.

**This guide does not focus on the soldered SSD within the Chromebook, but rather on adding external storage and hiding it within the Chromebook chassis. This project's goal is to modify current Chromebooks with non-upgradable, soldered NVMe or SSD storage modules that feel cheap and slow during use, while also offering very low storage (often 16/32GB). Despite current Google Drive storage options, some users cannot afford cloud storage beyond 15GB. WE WILL NOT BE DESOLDERING ANY COMPONENTS, MAKING THIS GUIDE RELATIVELY EASY.**

**Note:** This isnt possible on all chromebooks

 **TESTING IF MY SSD CAN FIT IN THE CHASSI**
