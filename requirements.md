# Requirements
This section of the tutorial covers what we will need before starting the mod.

### Materials
- **A chromebook with space inside of the computer chassi** (For this, either open your chromebook and check, or watch a dissassembly of the device you are getting, use the images in the [main README](/README.md#notes-and-recommendations) to check.)
- Spray paint that matches or is similar to the hue of the side of your computer (wherever your usb ports are). My side is gray, hence I got grey spray paint.
